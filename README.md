### Hej Hej

I am a Systems Biologist focusing on integrating multi-omics data in various network frameworks to untangle drivers of disease and most recently, the aging process. More than that though, I see myself as a problem solver who seeks out challenges and jumps at opportunity.
- ðŸ”­ I am currently working on:
  - [integrating blood and lung tissue 'omics in a GRN framework](https://github.com/dcolinmorgan/netZooPy/blob/milipeed/gpuMilipeed.ipynb)
  - repositioning drugs using sex-specific GRN controlling for annotated Y-chr in females
  - [speeding up network analysis across thousands of subject/samples](https://github.com/netZoo/netZooPy/blob/master/tutorials/gpupanda/gpuPanda_tutorial.ipynb)
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning to more accurately model complex systems to predict epigenetic regulatory effects across time via various neural network frameworks (conv-LSTN,RNN,GAN,etc.)
