### Hi there ðŸ‘‹


- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on:
  - integrating blood and lung tissue 'omics in a GRN framework
  - repositioning drugs using sex-specific GRN controlling for Y-chr in females
  - speeding up network analysis across thousands of subject/samples
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning to more accurately mathematically model complex systems to predict epigenetic regulatory effects across time, possibly training via neural networks (GAN/AAE/cVAE/etc.)
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on any fun nueral network projects to speed up inference of above aims
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about my time abroad
