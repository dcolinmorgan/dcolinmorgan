### Hej Hej

I am a Systems Biologist focusing on integrating multi-omics data in various network frameworks to untangle drivers of disease and most recently, the aging process. More than that though, I see myself as a problem solver who seeks out challenges and jumps at opportunity.
- ðŸ”­ I am currently working on:
  - integrating blood and lung tissue 'omics in a GRN framework
  - repositioning drugs using sex-specific GRN controlling for Y-chr in females
  - speeding up network analysis across thousands of subject/samples
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning to more accurately mathematically model complex systems to predict epigenetic regulatory effects across time, possibly training via neural networks (GAN/AAE/cVAE/etc.)
