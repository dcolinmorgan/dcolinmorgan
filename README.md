### Hej Hej

I am a postdoc fellow in systems biology focusing on integrating multi-omics data in various network frameworks to untangle drivers of disease and the aging process.
- ðŸ”­ I am currently working on:
   - [LSTM models for estimating proto-profiles of subjects via pseudo-time trajectories](https://github.com/dcolinmorgan/LTCOPDsex/blob/master/LTCOPD_TS_LSTM2.ipynb)
  - [integrating blood and lung tissue 'omics in a GRN framework](https://github.com/dcolinmorgan/netZooPy/blob/milipeed/gpuMilipeed.ipynb)
  - [speeding up network analysis across thousands of subject/samples](https://github.com/netZoo/netZooPy/blob/master/tutorials/gpupanda/gpuPanda_tutorial.ipynb)
